            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I am 23 years old, just graduated from the University of Greenwich in Accounting and Financial
                Information Systems BA (Hons) with Upper-Second Class (2.1) degree. You might be wondering why am I
                doing programming? Well, I have always been interested and passionate about programming since my 2nd
                year of univeristy, however I wasn't sure back then whether I really should take the step towards it and
                can I even do it!?</p>
            <p>I have been searching and digging about different types of pogramming to be familiarw with it and find
                out if it is really for me or not.</p>
            <p>One advantage I had was during my last academic year, there was a module called E-Business which involved
                creating a website, including UX Design and UI Design. While working on this it helped have a clear
                mind-set and realise that I really enjoy creating websites and seeing the final output is really
                fascinating</p>
