    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>I am 23 years old, just graduated from the University of Greenwich in Accounting and Financial Information Systems BA (Hons) with Upper-Second Class (2.1) degree. You might be wondering why am I doing programming? Well, I have always been interested and passionate about programming since my 2nd year of univeristy, however I wasn't sure back then whether I really should take the step towards it and can I even do it!?</p>
    <p>I have been searching and digging about different types of pogramming to be familiarw with it and find out if it is really for me or not.</p>
    <p>One advantage I had was during my last academic year, there was a module called E-Business which involved creating a website, including UX Design and UI Design. While working on this it helped have a clear mind-set and realise that I really enjoy creating websites and seeing the final output is really fascinating.</p>
